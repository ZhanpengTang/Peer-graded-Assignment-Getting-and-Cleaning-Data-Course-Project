# Peer-graded-Assignment-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This is a submited Github repo for the peer-graded assignment of Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. 

This repo mainly consists of three documents: my analysis code file named "run_analysis.R", the tidy dataset, and a code book that describes the variables in detail. 

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. Therefore, there are five main steps when cleaning the dataset:
1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
